## About This Project

**Noxar : The Crimson Moon** is a 2D mobile platformer game that I developed as part of my Master's Thesis in Mobile Application Development, which is titled "***Designing and Developing a Mobile Game using Unity***". It served as my entry into the world of game development.

In **Noxar : The Crimson Moon**, players assume the role of "**Noxar**", a hero wielding swords and magic, as he investigates the criminal organization known as "**The Crimson Moon**". It offers an engaging gameplay experience with a combination of platformer mechanics and RPG elements.

Throughout the game, players guide "**Noxar**" through various levels, battling monsters and overcoming obstacles. The hero collects coins that can be spent at a shopkeeper's mysterious store, where various enchanted items are available to help "**Noxar**" grow stronger in his quest.
